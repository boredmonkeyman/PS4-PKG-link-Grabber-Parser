# PS4 Game Scraper

A Python script that scrapes PS4 game information and download links from DLPSGame.com.

## Features

- Scrapes all game listings from the main directory page
- Extracts game titles, patch versions, and download links
- Filters out ad links and URL shorteners
- Saves results in organized text files
- Concurrent processing for faster scraping
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required packages:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `lxml` (recommended for faster parsing)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ps4-game-scraper.git
   cd ps4-game-scraper
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
   ```

## Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
python scraper.py
```

Advanced options:
```bash
python scraper.py --threads 10
```

### Arguments:
- `--threads`: Number of concurrent threads to use (default: 5)

## Output

The script creates:
- A directory called `ps4_games/` with individual text files for each game
- A consolidated `results.txt` file with all download links
- A `scraper.log` file with operation details

Each game file contains:
```
Game: [Game Title]
Patch: [Patch Version]
Download Links:
[list of download links]
```

## Configuration

You can modify these variables in the script:

```python
BASE_URL = "https://dlpsgame.com/list-all-game-ps4/"  # Source URL
OUTPUT_DIR = "ps4_games"  # Output directory
REQUEST_DELAY = 1  # Seconds between requests
MAX_RETRIES = 3  # Max retry attempts for failed requests

# Customize these lists to change what links are collected/blocked
DOWNLOAD_KEYWORDS = [...]  # Patterns for download links
BLOCKED_PATTERNS = [...]  # Patterns to exclude
```

## Notes

- Please use this tool responsibly and respect website terms of service
- Add delays between requests to avoid overloading the server
- The script may need updates if the website structure changes
- Not all download links may be valid or available
